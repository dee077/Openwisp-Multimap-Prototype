# üó∫Ô∏è OpenWISP MultiMap Prototype



This is a prototype to demonstrate how to render both a **geo map** and an **indoor floorplan overlay** using [NetJSONGraph](https://github.com/openwisp/netjsongraph). It is part of a GSoC idea to improve the general map experience in OpenWISP by supporting multi-view network visualizations.

## üåê Overview

- The main map (`netjsonmap.json`) shows a geographical network graph.
- On clicking any node, it triggers a full-screen overlay with:
  - A floorplan image (`floorplan.png`)
  - Another NetJSON graph (`netjsonmap-indoormap.json`) rendered on top.

This showcases how both global and localized (indoor) visualizations can coexist in the same UI.

## Run App

App can be run just by opening the index.html file.
